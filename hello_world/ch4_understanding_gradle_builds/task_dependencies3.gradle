/* When determining what order to run tasks, Gradle generates a Directed 
Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each task to be executed becomes a node in the 
graph. In a DAG, it's impossible to arrive at the same node twice, which means
that Gradle will never execute a task that has already been executed; even if
a single task is 'depended on' more than once. */

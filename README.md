# learning_gradle

Just a repo to play around with Gradle. Will mostly be following "Introducing Gradle" by Balaji Varanasi and Sudha Blida

Chapter 8: Publishing Artifacts was written for Nexus. I tried to switch to Artifactory for this chapter, but eventually I gave up on both because they both wound up being too much effort for a simple learning exercise.

Chapter 9: Continuous Integration focused entirely on Jenkins, there was no work done that can be pushed here.
